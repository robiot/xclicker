![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-c.svg) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/check-it-out.svg)](https://xclicker.xyz/downloads)

## Main features
 * Fairly simple layout;
 * Safe mode, to protect from unwanted behaviour;
 * Autoclick with a specified amount of time between each click;
 * Choose mouse button [Left/Right/Middle];
 * Choose click type [Single/Double/Hold];
 * Repeat until stopped or repeat a given amount of times;
 * Click on a specified location only;
 * Randomize the click interval;
 * Specify hold time per click;
 * Click while holding hotkey down;
 * Start / Stop with a custom hotkey;

### How much cps?
The highest I have got with it was around **750cps**, but that was still with 1 millisecond interval.\
With 0 millisecond interval, the focused application may freeze.
